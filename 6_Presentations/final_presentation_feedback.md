•	Title, Authors: yes

•	(15%) Motivation:  previous work on age-related diseases: Decision Trees and NN. The team presented the modeling approach and results from the very beginning (nice!). The team focused on Baseline (class=0), DT, LR, and NN.

•	(15%) Data:  When you introduce the tables for the two data sources add some text on top of them so we understand what we are looking at. I was a bit confused when I looked at the two histograms (each of them belonged to one of the two data sources you introduced earlier). 

•	(15%) Approach:  Used DT to assess feature importance. Decision Trees: XG Boost was their whining model (make sure to label the plots here). NN: Logistic (impossible to read the table that shows the ablation study). 

•	(30%) Experiments: The evaluation metrics were not consistent across the different models? Experiments – More complexity slide: this tunning belongs to which model?

•	(10%) Conclusions: ok                              

•	(15%) Code submission: yes, well organized code

•	Contributions: yes

•	General comment: The presentation felt a bit disorganized, not so easy to follow, especially the hyper-parameter tuning that was done for each model.
