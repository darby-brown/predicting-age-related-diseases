Overall feedback: the team outlined specific project plan. Discussed EDA and modeling techniques in detail.

Goal of competition: nice intro!

Context: nice! Could also add some literature review – i.e., show proof that people are working in this area.

Source of data: looks goodQ

Variable histogram: it’s very hard to see what are the features you are looking at. It probably doesn’t matter for this data given the anonymized features but good to know for the future.

Correlation matrix: nice!

Modeling: Random forest with bagging (motivation: used in medical research (add a citation). 

XGBoost (I liked that you mentioned advantages and disadvantages). Single-layer Perceptron model (not covered in class but it’s one of the first models in ML, so glad you are learning to implement it). The multilayer perceptron might be an overkill for your data (but ok to implement it for this class, you are learning ML tools).

Model evaluation: AUPRC (nice!). balanced log loss (nice!)
